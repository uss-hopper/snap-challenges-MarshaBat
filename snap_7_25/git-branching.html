		<h2>Question 1</h2>
		<h3>5 Types of Git Branches</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Master</li>
				<li>Develop</li>
				<li>Feature</li>
				<li>Branch 4</li>
				<li>Branch 5</li>
			</ul>
		<p>And example of one sprint cycle-- When a new repository is created in GitHub, a master branch is created. A develop branch is created from the master branch for the entire team. After the team has identified tickets to work on. Each team member will pull a copy of the develop branch to their local device. The team member will then create a feature branch from the develop branch. To work on the ticket, the team member creates a file locally where he/she will code. When the code is ready to be merged, the team member must add the file to their local branch, commit the file, and then push the file to GitHub. After review, testing and approval of the code with the team, the team member should pull a copy of the develop branch and then merge the feature branch to the develop branch. Once the team has reviewed, tested and approved of all feature branches merge to the develop branch, the master branch is pulled. The, the develop branch can be merged with the master.   </p>
